# Brunz
Brunz is an Android application made for Junction 2020 that ultilizes a predictive database, called [Aito](https://aito.ai/), to suggest lunch places for you and your colleagues!

How does it work:
- An application is made by basic Android components and some common libraries like Retrofit, RxJava and Picasso.
- A sandbox is provided by Aito.
- The application will make api calls to the sandbox in order to train the database and get predictive results, which will improve gradually.

Here is a preview of the application (a shout-out to my friend Nhut Trieu):
